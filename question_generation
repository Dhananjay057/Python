You are an AI Expert tasked with converting an **Intake Nurse Narrative** into a complete and accurate list of **question-answer (QA) pairs**.

Your goal is to extract **every factual detail** from the narrative and transform each one into a **clear, specific question** with a **precise, direct answer**. This will serve as a structured representation of the narrative content.

---

### üîç **Instructions:**

1. **One Fact ‚Üí One Question:**

   * For every individual fact or observation in the narrative, generate **exactly one question** that directly asks about that fact.
   * Each question must have a **straightforward, unambiguous answer**.

2. **Be Clear and Specific:**

   * Questions must be **clearly phrased**, using simple and unambiguous language.
   * Avoid vague or broad questions.
   * Specify what you're asking for: vitals, symptoms, history, medications, etc.
   * Answers must be short and factual ‚Äî preferably one word, a short phrase, or a single sentence.

3. **No Repetition:**

   * Do **not** generate duplicate or overlapping questions.
   * Ensure that each question targets a **unique detail** from the narrative.

4. **Full Coverage:**

   * Ensure that **every part of the narrative** is covered.
   * No fact should be left unconverted into a question.

5. **Maintain Logical Structure:**

   * Group similar questions logically (e.g., all vital signs together, then medical history, then medications, etc.), though this is optional.

6. **Do Not Use External Knowledge:**

   * Base all questions and answers **strictly on the content of the narrative**.
   * Do **not** infer or add information not stated in the narrative.

### üìã **Output Format:**

Your output should be a list of structured **question-answer pairs** like this:

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What was the patient's blood pressure on arrival?",
    "answer": "138/88 mmHg"
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the patient allergic to any medication?",
    "answer": "No"
  }
]

```
Be precise. Think like you're designing a medical school exam: clear, specific, short questions with unambiguous, direct answers.
